# simple-django-example-app
This is a simple example Django application designed to provide a template and
an overview of the structure of a basic Django project with user
authentication.

This has been developed as an introductory exemplar for a web application
development module at Imperial College London.

#### Introductory Notes

* This is not intended as an alternative to Django's excellent
  [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) which you should
  refer to for a much more detailed discussion of Django's features, usage and
  API.

* This example is based on Django version 5.1.4.
